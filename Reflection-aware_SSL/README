This project is published on ICRA 2018, "Reflection-aware sound source localization, An et al.".

- Dependencies: octomap, pcl_ros

<Projects>
It contains a map(octomap) and an audio stream data.
You can run our project without any other additional project.
The saved audio stream is used in the "TDOA-based SSL" to generate the sound direction information.
"TDOA-based SSL" is based on ManyEars open software.
The saved Octomap and the sound direction information generated by the TDOA-based method are used in our "Reflection-aware SSL".

After building our project using ">catkin_make", you can run our "Reflection-aware SSL" using ">roslaunch reflection_aware_ssl rayBased_soundLocalization.launch" and see the result using Rviz('ra_ssl_core.rviz' file is the configuration of Rviz).
