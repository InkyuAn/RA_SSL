This project is published on ICRA 2018, "Reflection-aware sound source localization, An et al.".

It works on ROS, Ubuntu.

For running this project, you have to link it to SLAM and TDOA-based method.
I used RTAB-map SLAM method and manyears TDOA-based method.

Also, dependencies are like below
" pcl_ros, pcl_conversions, std_srvs, octomap_ros, octomap_msgs, visualization_msgs, sensor_msgs".
